kippo-malware
=============

Kippo-Malware is a script that will download all malicious files stored as URLs in a Kippo SSH honeypot database. This is useful in situations where you have lost your files or something happened to your VPS/server but you still have your DB intact. Kippo-Malware also supports HTTP proxy usage to cover your IP and custom User-Agent values.
